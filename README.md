# The mighty bag that holds *many* secrets

Hello, adventurers, explorers, you who was lost and kinda stumbled into here and now you gotta stay and listen to me,
how are you all in this glorious day!

I bestow upon thee the one and only, the infamous, Bag of Holding!
Many try to imagine what it hides within its entrails, but few really, REALLY know what happens in here...
And you, lucky one, are about to get that precious, invaluable knowledge.

Come closer, and take a look for yourself...

### Ok but seriously, what the hell is this.

This *pretends* to be a webpage for our magical universe, which will hold their character's info, short stories, not so short stories,
cool drawings... whatever you want to create and show the world, or something like that.

### What is the cool tech we are gonna use?

- **Angular** as the frontend framework
- **Sass** tho I have no idea how to use that
- Maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaybe **GraphQL** for the API but if it's too difficult yknow, the classical restful api I'll ~~copy~~ gratefully look for... 
- *PixiJS* could be a cool framework for graphics and stuff, but who knows if we'll need that really
- **MongoDB** or **Firebase** for the database, maybe, I dunno

And that's it, *for now*.
